	<h1>Video + Sound</h1>

	<h2>"Remembering You"</h2>

	<p>"Tell a story, without telling a story."</p>

	<h3>. . .</h3>

	<p>My video was originally supposed to be someone who goes into depression and eventually drives</p>
	<p>himself to commit suicide, but as I was editing my project even more, I decided to change my</p>
	<p>theme to someone who lost their loved one due to a car accident. The video itself would seem like</p>
	<p>it is about a boy who is remembering the good times he had with his girlfriend and has now broken</p>
	<p>up with her. With the sound, however, it adds a more emotional aspect and changes the story to the</p>
	<p>boy losing their loved one due to a car accident.</p>

	<h3>. . .</h3>
	
	<p>To create this video, I used videos and photos that were shot using my HTC ONE A9 cell phone.</p>
	<p>I used Adobe Premiere to put everything together as well as crop them to make the camera angle changes</p>
	<p>more fluid-like. Doing this project was somewhat difficult since my laptop could not handle the</p>
	<p>application, but the ending result was perfectly fine to me.</p>
