	<h2>"The Closet"</h2>
	
	<p>"The Closet" tells a story about a girl and her history of past relationships which gets her thinking,</p>
	<p>"What should I do?" I wanted to make sure that my audience understands that it's not always easy</p>
	<p>to "come out of the closet" by explaining it through someone's personal experience. This shows that</p>
	<p>Net Art could be used as a "diary" that encourages others to read about in order to understand</p>
	<p>and empathize with the author. At the ending of the "game," I included websites that will help</p>
	<p>inform the "player" of subjects used to create the overall story of the main character.</p>

	<h3>. . .</h3>

	<p>For my Net Art, I used JPGs and MP4s as visuals. I also embedded music in the background for</p>
	<p>some choices. To create the visuals, I used Adobe Illustrator to create the backgrounds, and</p>
	<p>Adobe Photoshop to add the JPGs of the silhouttes onto it. I also used Adobe Photoshop to create</p>
	<p>the MP4s. This project was difficult to create since my laptop could not handle me making the MP4s.</p>
	<p>In return, I could not really know how fast each video was going until I exported them. I could</p>
	<p>have made GIFs, but I wanted to keep the "fade out" effect in the videos to give them more character.</p>
