	<h2>"Night, Distorted"</h2>

	<p>For this art project, I did not necessarily had an inspiration for it. I just thought it would be cool</p>
	<p>to see such a beautiful image, 'glitched' into something distorted. It ended up giving a "everything is</p>
	<p>not what it seems" kind-of vibe, which I actually quite like about this artwork.</p>

	<h3>. . .</h3>
	
	<p>To create this artwork, I converted my JPG file into a BMP file. I then used Audacity to play with</p>
	<p>some of the effects that it had provided and saved it as a BMP file with the encoding of "U-Law".</p>
	<p>(I had to open my files in Windows:Paint since PhotoShop did not want to co-operate with my "Glitch").</p>
	<p>After being satisfied with what I had created, I opened the new file with WordPad and saved it as is.</p>
	<p>(For Windows, it was able to further glitch the photo by just saving the file after it loaded).</p>
	<p>I then created this GIF using PhotoShop by importing each photo as a layer and using each layer as a new frame.</p>
